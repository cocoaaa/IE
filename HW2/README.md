# Relation Extraction as a classification task
This repository contains codes, datasets and reports for the assignment 2 of CSCI 699.

Relation extraction can be viewed as a classification task in which, given a sentence with a pair of labelled entities (eg. the two entities are already marked either manually or via NER classifier as in the assigment 1), our aim is to assign a label from a predefied set of relaiton types.
