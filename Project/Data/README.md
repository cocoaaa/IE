Spacenet Challenge datasets can be downloaded from the public [AWS](https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/datasets/spacenetRoads-summary.html). 
I use all training datasets from Las Vegas, Paris, Shanghai, and Khartoum for model training and selection. Each model is evaluated on each city's test set based on three metrics.

- Pixel-based F-1 score
- Area-based % intersection
- Graph-based: Average Path Length Score (APLS)

Details about each metric will be included in the final report.
